Testing Plan For Project 2: Shell

I used to test this commands on my program, my, mac, on temple server.

1) For Built-in commands:

Test executing simple commands, like pwd, help, wait, cd, exit.

2) Program execution with Full Path

Tested following:

usr/bin/wc main.c

Without Full Path and to test Environment Variables
echo $PATH
echo $Shell



3) Redirection test

ls > output.txt
cat output.txt
wc < input.txt
cat input.txt
wc < input.txt > output.txt


4) Pipes Testing

ls | grep output.txt | wc

5) Background process

echo Hello | wc &
sleep 10 &
